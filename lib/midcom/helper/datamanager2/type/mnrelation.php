/**
 * Datamanager 2 m:n membership management type.
 *
 * This subclass provides specialized I/O procedures which allow implicit management of
 * m:n object mappings. For example this can cover the person member assignments of a
 * midgard_group. The mapping class used is configurable, thus it should be adaptable to
 * any standard m:n relationship.
 *
 * The member objects used to construct this mapping must be fully
 * qualified DBA objects where the user owning the master object has full control, so
 * that the objects can be updated accordingly. It is recommended to make the member
 * objects children of the master objects. In addition, edit, delete and create rights
 * should always go together.
 *
 * To work properly, this class needs various information: First, there is the name of the
 * member class used to do the mapping. In addition to this, two fieldnames of that class
 * must be supplied, one for the GUID of the master object, the other for the identifier
 * of the membership.
 *
 * Optionally, you can set the class to use the master object ID in case of the GUID,
 * this is there for legacy code ("midgard_members") which do not use GUIDs for linking
 * yet. The linked object ("membership") is always referenced by the key selected in the
 * corresponding widget.
 *
 * An additional option allows you to limit the "visible" member key space: You specify
 * query constraints. When updating members, only member records matching
 * these constraints will be taken into account. This is quite useful in case you want to
 * split up a single selection into multiple "categories" for better usability. The
 * constraints are taken into account even when saving new keys so that all load and save
 * stays symmetrical. If you use this feature to separate multiple key namespaces from
 * each other, make sure that the various types do not overlap, otherwise one type will
 * overwrite the assignments of the other.
 *
 * When starting up, the type will only validate the existence of the mapping class. The
 * members specified will not be checked for performance reasons. In case something
 * wrong is specified there, it will surface during runtime, as invalid mapping entries
 * will be silently ignored (and thus saving won't work).
 *
 * This type should be set to a null storage location
 *
 * <b>Available configuration options:</b>
 *
 * - <i>string mapping_class_name:</i> Mandatory option. Holds the name of the DBA
 *   class used for the mapping code. The class must satisfy the above rules.
 * - <i>string master_fieldname:</i> Mandatory option. Holds the fieldname containing
 *   the (GU)ID of the master object in the mapping table.
 * - <i>string member_fieldname:</i> Mandatory option. Holds the fieldname containing
 *   the membership keys in the mapping table.
 * - <i>boolean master_is_id:</i> Set this to true if you want the ID instead of the GUID
 *   to be used for mapping purposes. Defaults to false.
 * - <i>array constraints:</i> These constraints limit the
 *   number of valid member keys if set (see above). It defaults to null meaning no limit.
 * - <i>Array options:</i> The allowed option listing, a key/value map. Only the keys
 *   are stored in the storage location, using serialized storage. If you set this to
 *   null, <i>option_callback</i> has to be defined instead. You may not define both
 *   options.
 * - <i>string option_callback:</i> This must be the name of an available class which
 *   handles the actual option listing. See below how such a class has to look like.
 *   If you set this to null, <i>options</i> has to be defined instead. You may not
 *   define both options.
 * - <i>mixed option_callback_arg:</i> An additional argument passed to the constructor
 *   of the option callback, defaulting to null.
 * - <i>boolean csv_export_key:</i> If this flag is set, the CSV export will store the
 *   field key instead of its value. This is only useful if the foreign tables referenced
 *   are available at the site of import. This flag is not set by default. Note, that
 *   this does not affect import, which is only available with keys, not values.
 * - <i>boolean sortable:</i> Switch for determining if the order selected by the widget
 *   should be stored to the metadata object
 * - <i>string sortable_sort_order:</i> Direction that metadata.score should go. If this
 *   is set to `ASC`, lower scores will be displayed first. If this is set to `DESC`, higher
 *   scores will be displayed first. `DESC` is default, since then new member objects will
 *   be left at the end of the line rather than appearing first. This field is not case
 *   sensitive and string can be extended e.g. to `ascend`.
 * - <i>array additional_fields:</i> Additional fields that should be set on the mnrelation object
 *
 * (These list is complete, including all allowed options from the base type. Base type
 * options not listed here may not be used.)
 *
 * <b>Option Callback class</b>
 *
 * See base type.
 *
 * <b>Implementation notes</b>
 *
 * This class essentially extends the select type, rewriting its I/O code to suite the
 * needs of a member management type.
 *
 * Therefore, we force-override a few settings to ensure operability: allow_other
 * will always be false, while allow_multiple always be true.
