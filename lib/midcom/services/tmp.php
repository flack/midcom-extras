/**
 * Temporary data management service.
 *
 * Currently the class supports management of temporary MidCOM objects.
 * One example where they are used is the creation mode wrapper of DM2.
 * No sessioning is done on the side of this class, you need to do that
 * yourself.
 *
 * Temporary objects are identified by their object ID, they are not
 * safely replicateable. A MidCOM CRON handler will delete all temporary
 * objects which have not been accessed for longer than one hour. Nevertheless
 * you should explicitly delete temporary objects you do no longer need using
 * the default delete call.
 *
 * <b>Temporary object privileges</b>
 *
 * All temporary objects have no privilege restrictions whatsoever. Everybody
 * has full control (that is, midgard:owner privileges) on the temporary object.
 * Newly created temporary objects have all their privileges reset, so that
 * applications can store privileges on temporary object which will be transferred
 * using the move_extensions_to_object() call on the temporary object (see there).
 *

     * The id member of the object is used in the future to reference it in
     * request and release operations. The GUID of the object should not be used
     * for further references.

     * In case the temporary object cannot be created, midcom_error is thrown.
     *
     * All existing privileges (created by the DBA core) will be dropped, so that
